README

Compiling:
From the root directory run 'make' or 'make all'

Flashing:
With the AVR butterfly connected run 'sudo make program'

Notes:
Time constraints and broken solder joints limited testing time.
Untested parts include; the buzzer, double click and end to end test.
The states are just functions, there is an array of the function pointers
that is used for state transitions along with the transition array for lookups.
There is an issue displaying the time in proper format.
I think the program mostly speaks for it self otherwise.
