Lab 3 Pre-emptive OS

All functions are working properly.

Single click toggles the sound and a doulbe click returns to the boot loader.

I created a third priority for the idle task so that it will only run if all the other tasks are waiting or blocked.

I increased the clock speed to 2Mhz to help with the task switching logic.
