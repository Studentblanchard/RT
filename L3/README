Lab 4 Wav player

I used a python program to generate the bit strings to be used by the wav player.

In the folder ./bitconverter/ there is a file called bitconverter.py, you can run it by running the following line in a terminal..

$> python bitconverter.py

The program will execute and it will create 4 files.

d2a.txt contains the bit string for 1 bit digital to analog conversion

diff.txt contains the bit string for diffence encoding.

os.txt contains the bit string for 4x oversampling, as such the file is 4 times larger than the previous two

os_diff.txt contains the final bit string. For this mode I chose to combine difference encoding and oversampling. In particular for each byte we compare it to the next and the previous bytes. This leads to 4 possible outputs per sample outlined below.

last <= curr <= next ? output => 0110
last  < curr  > next ? output => 1111
last  > curr  > next ? output => 1101
last  > curr  < next ? output => 0000

There are 4 main files, one per sampling type, change the Makefile to build whichever you want.

One issue I have had is when flashing the two larger files to the butterfly sometimes an error occurs and according to what I have found out about this is that it has to do with the size of the files being flashed. The exact error was "failed to verifiy " then some byte values. This is a butterfly limitation not a programming error.


NOTE: python version 2.7 was used, please ensure you are using the same version
